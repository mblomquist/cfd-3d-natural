# cfd-3d-natural

This is a simple computational fluid dynamics solver for a three-dimensional, natural convection problem that utilizes dimensionless parameters. 

## Status

Work in progress...

## Project Description

This repository contains a simple code base for solving two dimensional computational fluid dynamics problems using Fortran. The code base, by default, solve the Navier-Stokes equations using a finite-volume, power-law descritization methodology. 

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile using `make`.
3. Modify input parameters using the Python script, `helper.py`, or by modifying the `input2d.txt` file.
4. Run it `./build/main.out`

The program will generate results files for the pressure field, the temperature field, and the velocity fields in the `output` directory. 

## Changing Input Parameters

In progress...

## Read Output Files

Output files are created for the field data (temperature and pressure), u-velocity data, and v-velocity data in the ParaView data format.
